#Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

#Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:

#Number of vowels: 5

def main():
        s = raw_input()
# the input string is in s
# remove pass and start your code here
        count = 0

        for c in s:
                if(c == 'a' or c == 'e' or c == 'i' or c == 'o' or c == u):
                        count = count + 1

        print(count)
